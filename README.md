# Protein-Structure-Prediction
3rd Semester Project for Data Structures

Proteins are consists of 20 different amino acids and each acid is represented by different alphabets: A Q W E R T Y I P L K H F D S C V N M. In our project, we intend to deduce the percentage similarity of a protein with respect to 3 or 4 protein structures.

The protein structures will be stored in a text file and then be used for comparison. By using global alignment, the structures will be matched and count would be updated. We will then compare the match score of all known structures and the one with the highest match score will be the protein structure with highest similarity with the unknown sequence.
